# Brain Tumour Classification with Deep Learning

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify brain tumor types using MRI images. It also incorporates **Grad-CAM** visualization to interpret model decisions by highlighting discriminative regions.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

- Uses a **ResNet** (or variation) backbone to learn features from medical imaging data for tumor classification.  
- Enhances explainability by applying **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to visualize which parts of the image led to the classification.  
- Helps in medical diagnostics by providing both predictions and visual explanations.
